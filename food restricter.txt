On average, a number of 200,000 people die every year because of over eating or extreme fat

---------------------Solution----------------------
Nowadays, people are just tired of working or just don't want to get out of their comfy homes
and just get the dilevery boys get their job done, and even if some of them are 100 meters 
away from markets they just don't want to go, even they just don't want to cook food for 
themselves, so, the main root of this is the online dilevery apps, no, we can't force stop 
them, we just have to do something like a restriction on the amount of the food we order on 
the apps, it can be done by a food specialist that makes the diet chart, everytime a person 
goes on to the app to register themselves or to just oder food, it would keep a track the 
info of the order on the app everytime and restrict them from ordering a big amount of food
and that profile would be universal, meaning, that if person A would end up reaching the 
limit, the app would restruict him from ordering more amount of food and if it goes like 
hitting the limit in the app A and then gtting app B to order that same food, it would not be 
that easy, because it's a "universal profile" so he/she can not do it, they will have to wait
for the timeout end.
